This project is about doing dynamic data weave.
Here we do transformation from input.json which is in JSON format to required output format. It could be either XML or CSV format.

The client project is in test2 folder and when run in AnyPoint, one needs to run both Client and server together from run Configuration.
The client runs at 
	http://localhost:9081/run?transformation=csv or
	http://localhost:9081/run?transformation=xml
	
For testing server use below URLs :

http://localhost:8081/oil-mock-api/transformation/bookXML.dwl

http://localhost:8081/oil-mock-api/transformation/bookCSV.dwl


Step 1: Create the server project, give it any name. From the git project, copy the file transformation-config.xml in the AnyPoint Studio
Right Click on the project -> Mule -> Convert to AnyPoint project. 
You should see rest of the folders and files getting created in the project.

Now open the transformation-config.xml in Mule Properties , click on HTTP, click on + icon in the properties tab.
Give it a defult name like HTTP_Listener_configuration, now click on the next to +, here you leave the post as 8081 default and edit the Base Path to /oil-mock-api.
Now you are good to run the server and test it with above server URLs.



Similarly create the client project and clientProject folder and cnfigure HTTP_Listener_Configuration port to 9081 and define path to /run

Run both server and client projects as run config' : select both check boxes. Now test the client and server by using the client URLs

http://localhost:9081/run?transformation=csv or
	http://localhost:9081/run?transformation=xml
